            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <img src="images/cinny3.gif" alt="">
            <p><strong>Web Privacy Guide</strong> is a website aimed primarily at young adults, teens, and parents of teens who want to maximize their online privacy and security. It is a nonprofit project organized primarily by one person.</p>
            <p>In the Internet-focused age we live in today, it is important now more than ever before to keep ourselves safe online. In recent years we have seen increasing legislation that would give governments and companies access to our private information and browsing activities. We all have heard the jokes about having our own "personal" FBI agent who watches over our online activity. Even beyond government/corporate spying, it's also important to keep yourself safe from malicious users who would want to use your information against you.</p>
            <p>We here at Web Privacy Guide believe privacy is a universal human right and would like to give you the tools to help you protect this right. Here, you will find tutorials for hardening your security online and information on how to remain private online. Many websites assume familiarity with the intricacies of things such as Internet protocols, network security, and more. Hopefully, we will be able to simplify these details and make things easier for the average user to understand.</p>
            <p>This website is licensed under the Peer Production License. The Peer Production License is an example of the Copyfair type of license, in which only other commoners, cooperatives and nonprofits can share and re-use the material, but not commercial entities intent on making profit through the commons without explicit reciprocity. This fork on the original text of the Creative Commons non-commercial variant makes the PPL an explicitly anti-capitalist version of the CC-NC. It only allows commercial exploitation by collectives in which the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the value creators, and where any surplus is distributed equally among them (and not only into the hands of owners, shareholders or absentee speculators). According to Dmytri Kleiner, co-author of the license with the barrister John Magyar, it’s not a copyleft license, but instead copyFARleft, and is intended for consumer goods or commodities rather than capital or producers’ goods. </p>
