               <summary>Q: Some of your information is outdated. When will you update it?</summary>
               <p>The person who runs this site works on tons of other projects and doesn't always keep up to the date with the latest news and privacy policy changes. If you'd like to let us know about any new updates, please send us an <a href="mailto:helianthuswillow@gmail.com">email</a> with the info and any additional details (i.e. links to official sources).</p>

               <summary>Q: I don't agree with some of the opinions or recommendations on your site, will you change them?</summary>
               <p>While we are open to constructive criticism, we also have a specific set of principles and will not change them to fit someone else's opinions. When it comes to some more oft-debated topics (i.e. which browser is most secure, is a vpn better than a proxy) we try to observe all the facts and include pros and cons of any particular method when possible. Remember, all of the things on this site are <em>suggestions</em>, so you should do your own research and make your own decisions about how you handle your online life.

               <summary>Q: Can I use the advice on this website to safely engage in illegal activities online?</summary>
               <p>A: This site was conceived as a result of concerns over large corporations harvesting our data and selling it to advertisers and governments. In a world where the FBI will arrest you for making an off-color Twitter joke, we take this very seriously. However, we aren't encouraging people who take our advice to go out and do anything illegal. We wouldn't know if our advice could be used for illegal means because we haven't tried, and we don't take any responsibility for what you do with the information provided here.</p>

               <summary>Q: Do you accept contributions from other people?</summary>
               <p>Sure! Send us your submission via <a href="mailto:helianthuswillow@gmail.com">email</a> and we'll review it to see if it meets our guidelines. We aren't very strict - we just ask you keep things simple and informative.</p>

               <summary>Q: Are you getting paid to promote [insert software] on your site?
               </summary>
               <p>We are not sponsored by anyone or any company at this time, and we don't intend to start accepting paid promotions. This site is non-profit and intended to inform people about their options - not to convince them any given option is the right or best one. In an age where data harvesting from corporations is the norm, we remain skeptical of any corporate attempts to push a specific product.</p>
